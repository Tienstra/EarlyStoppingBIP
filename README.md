# EarlyStoppingBIP

This project provided an alternative approach to cross-validation for hyperparameter selection. We
were interested in optimally selecting the prior hyperparameter in a Bayesian inverse problem. Simulations were also performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the early stopping method. These results were used in the following papers: 

1. Early Stopping for Ensemble Kalman-Bucy Inversion (Tienstra Reich https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18353)
2. Early Stopping of EKI for Linearisable Non-linear problems (draft on request)
